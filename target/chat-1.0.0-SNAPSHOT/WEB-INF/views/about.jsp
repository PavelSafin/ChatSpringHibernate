        Toster is an instant messaging system focusing on privacy and multi-platform availability. Toster clients exist for both mobile (Android, iOS, Windows Phone) and desktop
        systems (Windows, OS X, Linux). Toster users can exchange messages encrypted end-to-end, self-destructing messages, along with photos, videos and files of any type up
        to 1.5GB in size.
        Toster is run by a German nonprofit organization backed by entrepreneur and philanthropist Pavel Safin. Its client code is open-source software, while its server-side code is
        currently proprietary. Software is also available from independent developers who make use of the Toster API.
